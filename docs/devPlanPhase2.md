# Development Plan: Phase 2 - Commercial Scaled Web Application

This document outlines the plan for Phase 2 of the `transcriptor-app` project, focusing on building a commercial, cloud-hosted web application. This phase builds upon the core logic developed in Phase 1 (Local Desktop Application).

- **Goal:** Build a robust, scalable, cloud-hosted web application for a commercial transcription service. This forms the core of the commercial offering.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Backend API:** Cloud-hosted API (Flask/FastAPI). Handles user requests, authentication, and job management.
  - **Task Queue System:** Decouple processing using a Message Broker (Redis/RabbitMQ) and Task Queue Library (Celery/RQ).
  - **Worker Processes:** Cloud-hosted workers execute the transcription pipeline (reusing logic from Phase 1 where applicable).
  - **Result Storage:** Cloud Storage (S3/GCS) for transcript files, Database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB) or Redis for job status/metadata.
  - **Frontend:** Sophisticated web UI built with a modern JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Svelte).
  - **Authentication:** Implement user accounts and secure authentication.
  - **(Optional) Billing:** Integrate a payment/subscription system.
- **Key Tasks:**
  1.  Design cloud infrastructure (compute, storage, database, broker).
  2.  Develop and deploy the Backend API with user authentication and job submission/status/result endpoints.
  3.  Set up and configure the Message Broker and Task Queue system.
  4.  Develop and deploy Worker processes, ensuring they have necessary dependencies (`ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`) likely via containerization (Docker). Adapt Phase 1 processing logic for the worker context.
  5.  Implement robust result storage using Cloud Storage and/or a database.
  6.  Develop the sophisticated web frontend using React/Vue/Svelte.
  7.  Implement user authentication flows on both frontend and backend.
  8.  (Optional) Integrate billing/subscription management.
  9.  Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting for the cloud infrastructure.
- **Outcome:** A scalable, reliable, commercial web application offering transcription as a service, ready for user sign-ups and potential monetization.
